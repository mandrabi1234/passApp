#*-----------------------------------------------------*#


#* 1. Quality Control
#   *1a. clean training and testing data
#   *1b. confirm that resulting dataframes are of the correcct dimensions by checking their shapes

train, trainOG = cleanTrain(Euro) # clean training data set
print(train.shape) # check shape

test1, test = cleanTest(oxyplayerdata) # clean test data set
print(test.shape) # check shape

OxyData = test1 # clean data set for later use
print(OxyData.shape) #check shape


#* 2. Model Execution
#   *2a. split the data into training and test sets
#   *2b. run MoBot on training and test input

train_features, train_labels, test_features, test_labels = split(train, test) # 2a


labels_pred = rfc(train_features, train_labels, test_features, test_labels) # 2b

#* 3. DataFrame Preparation
#   *3a. Add prediction data to previously cleaned dataframe
#   *3b. Create a separate, duplicate dataframe for additional performance analysis
#       *3b.1. Sort and separate dataframe to only include Occidental College shot information
#   *3c. 

OxyData['xG'] = labels_pred # 3a

# Sort and separate dataframe to only include Occidental shot information

specs = teamSort(OxyData)

# Sort and separate dataframe to only include Occidental shot information

# Calculate Season Goal performance Stats

# Extract total instances for each body part (i.e. figure out how much each one was used across the season)
rightFoot, leftFoot, head = bodyPart(specs)


# Extract player performance stats for the entire season
playerSeasonEval = playerSeasonEval(specs)

# Calculate team stats on p90 basis

# Create dataframe consisting of season goal performance stats

# 4. Upload prediction data to Google Sheets
#   *4a. Access xG Stats Google Spreadsheet
#   *4b. Declare and initialize each individual worksheet within xG Stats Google Spreadsheet
#   *4b. Update xG Stats 
#   *4c.


# Access Google Spreadsheet
sh = gc.open('xG Stats')

wks4 = sh[4] # Fifth worksheet: Game_player

wks5 = sh[5] # Sixth worksheet: Season_GK

wks10 = sh[9] # Tenth worksheet: Opposition Seasonal Stats

#--Update Google Spreadsheet(s) according to input parameters--#

wks.set_dataframe(OxyData, (1,1)) # Update the entire spreadsheet with OxyData dataframe (raw xG data)

wks1.set_dataframe(seasonStats, (1,1)) # Update the entire spreadsheet with seasonStats dataframe (team's seasonal performance)

wks2.set_dataframe(playerSeasonEval, 'E1') # Update the spreadsheet starting from Cell 'E1' with playerSeasonEval (players' seasonal performance)

wks3.set_dataframe(perGameStats_Team, (1, 1)) # Update the entire spreadsheet with perGameStats_Team dataframe (team's performance per game for '19-20 season)
